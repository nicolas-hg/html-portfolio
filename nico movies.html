<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr>
<h3>1. Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie ever made, I love the deep connection between the philosophical and the science.</p>
<h3>2. Arrival</h3>
<p>Amazing way to portrai how an alien invasion would look like addressing the human modern issues</p>
<h3>3. Soul</h3>
<p>Very deep animated film that talks about the purpose of life</p>
